# Task Management System

This is a simple task management project for the Front End Development test by INEO. The project is built using Angular, Tailwind CSS, and JSON Server (to mock a database).

## Development server

To run use command `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Concurrently dependency allows the application to automatically start JSON Server as well. It will run on port `http://localhost:3000/`
