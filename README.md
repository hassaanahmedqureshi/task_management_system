	# Task Management System

	This is a simple task management project for the Front End Development test by INEO. The project is built using Angular, Tailwind CSS, and JSON Server (to mock a database).


	## Development server

	To run use command `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

	To run json server use `npm run start:json-server` which will run on port `http://localhost:3000/`
